This project introduces the process manipulation facilites in the Unix/Linux Operating System.
Contained is the program 'doit' which takes another command as an argument and executes that command.
After the command is carried out and all processes are exited succesfully, 
	doit prints out various statistics about the processes.
To compile, point shell to directory containing all files and use 'make' command to complile.
To run, use ./doit [command].

For example, 
==> ./doit sleep 3
	will carry out the command sleep with an argument of 3

Additional comments:
	Only part 1 of this assignment has been fully completed, partly due to time constraints.
